# avahi-lb

an operator which publishes a hostname for IPs for `type: LoadBalancer` `Service`s in kubernetes.

## Description

When using [k3s](https://k3s.io/) with [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/), each `Service` obtains an IP from the
pool.

You can use this operator in order to propagate a DNS name for this IP.

## Usage

You need to set the environment variable `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN` in order to define the suffixes for the hosts.

When publishing a service, add the annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/avahi-publish` and:

- either set it to `"-"` in order to generate
  `<name>.<namespace>.${KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN}` ([example](config/samples/service.yaml))
- or use an explicit prefix in order to generate
  `<prefix>.${KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN}` ([example](config/samples/service_explicit.yaml))

## Helm chart

Helm charts are created from the [charts directory](charts) and published
to [this repository](https://tanemahuta.github.io/avahi-lb).
Use `--set-string kubernetesClusterDomain=<clustername>.local` to set `KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_DOMAIN`.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for
testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever
cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Configuration

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/avahi-lb:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/avahi-lb:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Feel free to PR or create issues.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the
Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the
cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
